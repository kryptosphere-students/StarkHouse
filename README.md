## Short Description

StarkHouse is a hackathon project at MuBuenos in Argentina in April 2024. 

Starkhouse leverages Giza tech, a ZKML database to provide fair and secure housing matching between potential renters and house providers on the Argentinian market. This project aims to leverage efficient and fair matching on a secure database, not accessible to any third party. This app enables the treatment of highly sensitive data. The model can be extended to any matching system on any population.


StarkHouse is a verified system providing proof of fair matching on Starknet provided by Giza. 


StarkHouse can power any private or public housing marketplace with fair and efficient matching. 

## Problem

### Stake #1 - unefficiency housing attribution

Currently, we can remark a unefficiency in housing attribution, with an unfairness of the system not based neither on the urgency nor the need.

### Stark #2 - lack of privacy

Currently, when you're looking for to rent an apartment, you need to provide some sensitive information like the amount on your bank account, for instance.

## How does it built

StarkHouse MVP leveraged ZKML, that is powered by a custom machine-learning system based on an optimized linear regression. Trained on a curated Dataset of rental properties in Argentina and matched with a dataset of Argentinian credentials and revenues.

- [Giza AI actions](https://actions.gizatech.xyz/) to 
- [Orion](https://orion.gizatech.xyz/) (Giza) to generate proofs and verify them
- [Linear Regression](https://actions.gizatech.xyz/tutorials/traditional-ml-models-for-zkml/linear-regression) to establish a score and match houses and users
- [QuarkID](https://quarkid.org/) to use an Argentinian ZK database
- Rajouter autre database

Put some Escalidraw flows

## How does it work for a user

To complete

### Apply for an housing

To complete

### Guarantee privacy of sensitive data

User going to encrypt their sensitive data in order to rent an apartment using verifiable credentials.

## Roadmap

- New use cases unblocked using any matching system with sensitive data (grants, marketplace, rewards)
- SDK to improve matching system on any housing marketplace

### About the SDK

- Public systems: any allocation system that matches people with needs
- Private systems: custom matching programs depending of the need
