    This command has different behavior depending on the framework:

        * For Cairo, it will transpile the specified file and upload it to Giza.
        * For EZKL, it will create a version and perform the trusted setup, creating al the necessary files for it.

    This command performs several operations:

        * Creates a version for the specified model
        * Uploads the specified file
        * Updates the status to UPLOADED
        * Polls the version until the status is either FAILED or COMPLETED
        * If the status is COMPLETED, downloads the model to the specified path

    Error handling is also incorporated into this process.

    Depending on the framework, this command will do different things:

        * For EZKL, it will generate a proof using the provided input, all the trusted setup will be retrieve during the job.

    This command will create a job with the specified size, but the amount of jobs will be rate limited by the backend.

    This command will do a couple of things behind the scenes:

        * Create a Proving Job

        * Check the status of the job periodically

        * If the jobs status is `COMPLETED` then the proof has been created at Giza
